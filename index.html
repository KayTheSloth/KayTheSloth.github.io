          <h2>Suggestions from me</h2>
          <p> Here are some animes you should watch if you are interested in anime</p>
              <p>Danganronpa (all 3 seasons are good, but I definetly recomend at least watching the first season</p>
              <p>Nekopapara (its cool)</p>
               <p>My Hero Acedamia (I haven't watched it yet, but it's a really good show</p>
          <p> Here are some games you should play if you are bored</p>
          <p>Minecraft (super fun and entertaining)</p>
          <p>Fortnite (Not everyone likes it but its a pretty decent game)</p>
          <p> Call of Duty (Not a specific one, you can try dfferent versions of it and see which one or ones you like best)</p>
          <p>Roblox (You can create a custom avatar and play or create your own game)</p>
          <p> Here are some sports I like to play, and some of my favorite sports</p>
          <p>Football (I have played football for 4 years now and will probably keep playing, but the reason why is because it is such a fun sport and I love getting to play with my friends in this awesome sport)</p>
          <p>Basketball. Basketball is a fun and entertainming sport, and even thought i don't play it that oftnen, I still think it's a good sport and I woujld like to learn it more and bcome better at it.</p>
          <p>Soccer. I played Soccer when i was around 3 and 4, and I love it. It was super fun playing with my friends on the small field and getting to get some chips after practoces and games.</p>
